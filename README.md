## Motivation

This project was motivated by my need to keep track of my tasks during my work day.

## Problem Solved

This app tracks my day-to-day tasks and stores them locally so I can return to it at any time to check what else I have to do. 

## What I Learned
As a result of this project, I have learned how to use third party APIs including JQuery and DayJs. The use of these libraries has significantly cut down on the amount of code required to make this app function.

## Site Access
This site was built using Github Pages and can be found [here](https://craigrobertsdev.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)
