## Description

A simple day planner that persists data to your browser for keeping track of your commitments for the day.

## Installation

No dependencies are required to use this page.

## Usage

This project is deployed using GitHub Pages [here](https://craigrobertsdev.github.io/work-day-scheduler/).

The first time the page loads, you will be presented with empty hour slots for a typical 9-5 work day. Depending on the time of day you're on the page, the slots will be green if they are in the future, red if it is the current hour and grey if the time has passed.

Enter events into the planner and click the save button to store them in your browser's storage for future use.
